Verily,

I am Anirudh, known in some circles as dh00mk3tu. My passions encompass the realms of computer science, composition, and fiction. At times, I find solace in sketching. My skills extend to modest proficiency in coding and the artistry of both UI and software design. I find joy in crafting solutions that operate on a grand scale, leaving a significant imprint.

Beyond these pursuits, my aspiration is to embody noble virtues and extend aid to others as providence allows.

With utmost regards,

Anirudh
