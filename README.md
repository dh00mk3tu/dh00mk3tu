Hi, I'm Anirudh, or dh00mk3tu if you may!
I love computer science, compositions and fictional literature. 
My interests compel me to draw sometimes and I can code a little bit, desing a bit too both UI and software. 
I enjoy making things that operate at scale and create impact. 
</p>

<p>
I'm currently working as a Sr. Software Engineer. 
As the TL, I am leading a team of engineers to write excellent software fighting against the undefined allegations of JavaScript.
GCP, NUXT and i18n SME
